- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aves-Proxy.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lotta stuff. Gaming, writing, and art are my everlasting hobbies, but I'm hoping to add programming to that list.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development, with a focus on the front-end. I've learned basic HTML and CSS, and done a few hackjob projects with that knowledge. Alongside learning intermediate skills for those two languages, I'm excited to pick up JavaScript soon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner projects to practice concepts and eventually build a portfolio. I don't have the skills to do too much, yet, but I'm working on getting there.
- 📫 How to reach me: best bet is to contact me via discord. Will add it here soon.
